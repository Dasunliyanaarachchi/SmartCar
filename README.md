# SmartCar

This repository is a project in two parts: An Arduino-based robotic vehicle and an Android application with which to 
control it.

The application provides two means of vehicle control:

1. The vehicle follows a path which is drawn directly on the touchscreen of the portable device, stopping automatically if an obstacle is detected along the path.

2. The vehicle can be manually controlled with a virtual joystick.

More advanced features of the app include the possibility for the user to draw a path directly upon a background of 
their choice by uploading an image (such as a blueprint), scaling, and different path simplification options.
